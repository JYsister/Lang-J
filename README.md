# Lang-J
This is the programming language I created independently.

At present, it is not perfect. For some reason, the update log in the .cpp file is in Chinese.

I will give the update log in English.

## Use guide
### Output

You can use `<"xxx"` to output a string `xxx`.

You also can use `<xxx` to output a variable named `xxx`, but you should enter it to declare this variable.

### Input

You can use `>xxx` to enter a variable named `xxx`. The data type of the variable depends on the input content.

**Note: when inputting a string, its effect is the same as that of C++ `cin>>string;` equally.**

### Note

You can use `$xxx` as a comment.

### `DONE.`

You must write this code after writing the program to end the program.
